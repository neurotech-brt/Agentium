## Phase 13: Autonomous Agent Orchestration 🚧

**Goal:** Maximum automation for large-scale agent management — self-healing, predictive scaling, and continuous self-improvement — without human intervention on routine operations.

**Version target:** 1.2.0-alpha  
**Builds on:** circuit breaker (`agent_orchestrator.py`), partial `auto_scale_check` stub (`task_executor.py`), Celery beat schedule, ChromaDB RAG pipeline, checkpoint service, voting service.

### What Already Exists — Do Not Rewrite

| Component                      | Location                  | Phase 13 Extends It By…                                          |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Circuit breaker (per-agent)    | `agent_orchestrator.py`   | Auto-escalate `OPEN` state → Council micro-vote                  |
| `auto_scale_check` Celery task | `task_executor.py`        | Actually call `AgentLifecycleService.spawn_agent()` — stub today |

### 13.1 Automatic Task Delegation Engine

**Purpose:** Eliminate manual task routing — every task is automatically scored, broken down, and assigned to the correct agent tier.

#### Backend

- [x] **Complexity Analyzer** (`backend/services/auto_delegation_service.py`) — score tasks 1–10 on creation; map: 1–3 → `3xxxx` TaskAgent, 4–6 → `2xxxx` LeadAgent, 7–10 → Council deliberation
- [x] **Sub-task Breakdown** — for score ≥ 7, decompose via LLM mini-call; persist sub-tasks with `parent_task_id` FK and dependency order in new `task_dependencies` junction table
- [x] **Capability-Aware Assignment** — rank candidate agents by `(1 - error_rate) × (1 / current_load)` using `CapabilityRegistry`
- [x] **Auto-Escalation Timer** — Celery beat every 60 s: tasks stuck in `in_progress` beyond `escalation_timeout` (default 300 s) → re-assign to next tier or trigger Council micro-vote
- [x] **Dependency Graph Parallelizer** — build DAG from `task_dependencies`; dispatch independent branches as parallel Celery `group()` tasks
- [x] **Priority Queue Rebalancer** — on `CRITICAL` / `SOVEREIGN` task arrival, re-sort the Celery queue without losing in-flight tasks
- [x] **Smart Retry Router** — on failure, re-dispatch to a different agent of the same tier; never retry on an agent with `CB_OPEN`
- [x] **Cost-Aware Delegation** — if `idle_budget < 20%`, force simple tasks to local Ollama regardless of tier preference

#### Alembic Migration — `009_task_delegation.py`

- [x] `task_dependencies` table: `task_id` (FK), `depends_on_task_id` (FK), `dependency_type` (`sequential | parallel`), `created_at`
- [x] `complexity_score` (Integer, nullable) on `tasks`
- [x] `escalation_timeout_seconds` (Integer, default 300) on `tasks`
- [x] `delegation_metadata` (JSONB) on `tasks`

#### API Routes

- [x] `POST /tasks/auto-delegate` — force re-delegation with optional `force_tier`
- [x] `GET /tasks/{id}/delegation-log` — return delegation decision trail from `delegation_metadata`
- [x] `GET /tasks/{id}/dependency-graph` — return DAG as `{ nodes, edges }` for frontend rendering

#### Frontend

- [x] `AutoDelegationPanel.tsx` — complexity score badge, tier assignment rationale, candidate agents ranked by score
- [x] Manual override dropdown — calls `POST /tasks/auto-delegate`
- [x] DAG viewer using React-Flow; nodes colored by status, edges labeled sequential vs parallel
- [x] Escalation countdown timer on in-progress tasks (amber → red as timeout approaches)
- [x] Extend `TaskCard.tsx` — add complexity score pill and "delegated by AI" vs "manually assigned" label

---

### 13.2 Self-Healing & Auto-Recovery System

**Purpose:** Detect failures and recover automatically without human intervention.

#### Backend

- [x] **Circuit Breaker → Council Auto-Escalation** — when `CB_OPEN` transitions, immediately enqueue a `EMERGENCY` micro-vote via `VotingService`; currently silent
- [x] **Exponential Backoff** — replace fixed 60 s retry in `execute_task_async` with `min(2 ** retry_count, 60)` seconds (1 → 2 → 4 → 8 → 16 → 32 → 60 cap)
- [x] **Agent Crash Detection** (`backend/services/reincarnation_service.py`) — Celery beat every 30 s: agents with `status = 'working'` and `last_heartbeat_at > 2 min` → mark crashed, emit `agent_crashed` WebSocket event
- [x] **State Restoration from Checkpoint** — on crash, call `CheckpointService.get_latest(agent_id)`; restore `ethos`, `current_task_id`, `context_window_snapshot`
- [x] **Agent Reincarnation** — spawn replacement via `AgentFactory` with restored state; re-queue interrupted task in `ASSIGNED` status
- [x] **Graceful Degradation Mode** — if all API providers have `CB_OPEN`: pause tasks with `priority < HIGH`, continue CRITICAL/SOVEREIGN on local Ollama, emit `system_mode_change` WebSocket banner
- [x] **Critical Path Protection** — tag tasks that are DAG ancestors of CRITICAL/SOVEREIGN leaves; reserve one agent slot permanently for these chains
- [x] **Self-Diagnostic Routine** — daily Celery beat: check DB connection pool, Redis ping, ChromaDB collection counts, disk usage, stale task count; auto-propose constitutional amendment if repeated violations detected
- [x] **DB Connection Pool Auto-Recovery** — wrap `CelerySessionLocal` in `tenacity` retry loop (5 attempts, 2 s wait) on `OperationalError`
- [x] **Heartbeat Task** — Celery beat every 60 s: each active agent writes `last_heartbeat_at = utcnow()`

#### Alembic

- [x] Add `last_heartbeat_at` (DateTime, nullable) column to `agents` table

#### Beat Schedule Additions to `celery_app.py`

- [x] `agent-heartbeat` — 60 s
- [x] `crash-detection` — 30 s
- [x] `self-diagnostic-daily` — 86400 s
- [x] `critical-path-guardian` — 120 s

#### Frontend

- [x] Self-Healing Events feed in `MonitoringPage.tsx` — reincarnation events, circuit state changes, degradation activations
- [x] System mode banner: normal (hidden) / degraded (amber) / critical (red) — driven by `system_mode_change` WebSocket event
- [x] "One-Click Rollback" button per healing action — calls `POST /admin/rollback/{audit_id}`

---

### 13.3 Predictive Auto-Scaling

**Purpose:** Anticipate workload changes and scale proactively, not reactively.

#### Backend

- [x] **Time-Series Store** (`backend/services/predictive_scaling.py`) — every 5 min, snapshot `pending_task_count`, `active_agent_count`, `avg_task_duration_seconds`, `token_spend_last_5m` to Redis sorted set; retain 7 days, auto-trim
- [x] **Load Predictor** — weighted moving average (`[0.5, 0.3, 0.2]`) over time-series; output: `next_1h`, `next_6h`, `next_24h` predictions
- [x] **Pre-Spawn Decision** — if `next_1h_prediction > current_capacity × 0.8`: call `AgentLifecycleService.spawn_agent(tier=3)` immediately; log to `AuditLog`
- [x] **Pre-Liquidation Decision** — if `next_6h_prediction < current_agents × 0.3` AND agent idle > 30 min: trigger existing auto-termination path
- [x] **Fix `auto_scale_check` stub** — replace `# In production: actually spawn agents` comment with real `AgentLifecycleService.spawn_agent(tier=3, count=recommended_agents, db=db)` call
- [x] **Resource-Aware Scheduler** — check Redis memory and PG connection pool before spawning; if either > 85%, delay non-critical dispatch 30 s
- [x] **Token Budget Guard** — daily cap via `DAILY_TOKEN_BUDGET_USD` env var (default `10.00`); at 80% downgrade new task allocations to cheapest model; at 100% pause non-CRITICAL tasks, emit `budget_exceeded` WebSocket event
- [x] **Time-Based Policy** — read `BUSINESS_HOURS_TZ`, `BUSINESS_HOURS_START`, `BUSINESS_HOURS_END` env vars; outside hours, cap active task agents at 2

#### Beat Schedule Additions

- [x] `load-metrics-snapshot` — 300 s
- [x] `predictive-scaling-check` — 300 s

#### API Routes (`backend/api/routes/scaling.py` — new file)

---

### 13.6 Intelligent Event Processing ✅

**Purpose:** Automatically react to external webhooks, threshold breaches, and scheduled polls — translating signals into tasks and workflows without manual dispatch.

#### Backend — New Models (`backend/models/entities/event_trigger.py`)

- [x] `EventTrigger` entity: `id`, `name`, `trigger_type` (`webhook | schedule | threshold | api_poll`), `config` (JSONB), `target_workflow_id` (FK nullable), `target_agent_id` (FK nullable), `is_active`, `last_fired_at`, `fire_count`

- [x] **External API Poller** — Celery beat every `config.poll_interval_seconds`: `GET config.url`; compare response hash to last known hash in Redis; fire on change
- [x] **Event Correlation Engine** — group `EventLog` entries with same `correlation_id` prefix within 60 s window; submit as single consolidated task
- [x] **Dead Letter Queue** — events failing processing 3 times → `dead_letter` status; expose for manual review
- [x] **Circuit Breaker for Events** — if a trigger fires > `config.max_fires_per_minute` (default 10) per minute, pause trigger for `config.pause_duration_seconds`

| `/events`                        | `EventTriggerManager.tsx`      |

#### Implementation Order

1. **13.2 Self-Healing** first — heartbeat and crash detection are required by 13.3 for accurate agent counts
2. **13.1 Task Delegation** — `task_dependencies` table (Migration 007) is required by 13.5
3. **13.3 Predictive Scaling** — fix `auto_scale_check` stub now that 13.2 heartbeats provide accurate capacity data
4. **13.6 Event Processing** — independent; can be built in parallel
5. **13.4 Self-Improvement** — depends on real-time learning data from 13.1 completions
6. **13.5 Workflow Engine** — depends on 13.1, 13.2, and 13.6 being stable
7. **13.7 Zero-Touch Dashboard** — aggregates metrics from all prior sub-phases

#### Phase 13 — Success Criteria

- [ ] Task created, complexity-scored, broken into sub-tasks, and assigned to correct tier without a single manual action
- [ ] Simulated agent crash detected, reincarnated from checkpoint, interrupted task resumed within 3 minutes
- [ ] Load predictor pre-spawns agents before simulated surge; no pending task waits > 60 s for an agent
- [ ] Task success rate improvement ≥ 5% measurable in `GET /improvements/impact` after 7 days
- [ ] 5-step workflow with conditional branching and one human-approval gate executes end-to-end from cron trigger
- [ ] External webhook fires → task created and dispatched within 10 seconds
- [ ] Zero-Touch Dashboard shows all 5 health rings green under normal operating conditions
- [ ] Daily token budget guard prevents overspend: CRITICAL tasks continue, normal tasks pause

---

## Phase 14: Frontend Reliability & Browser 🔮

**Goal:** Harden the frontend runtime and complete browser task visibility.

### 14.1 Live Screenshot Stream for Browser Tasks

- [x] **Backend** — extend `browser.py`: emit screenshot frames as base64 via WebSocket event `browser_frame` at configurable FPS (default 2); add `GET /browser/sessions/{id}/stream` endpoint for polling fallback
- [x] **Frontend** — `BrowserTaskViewer.tsx`: subscribe to `browser_frame` WebSocket events; render frames in an `<img>` tag with smooth replacement; show URL bar, page title, and action log alongside screenshot
- [x] Add to `TaskCard.tsx`: "View Live" button when `task_type = 'browser'` and status is `in_progress`; opens `BrowserTaskViewer` in a modal or slide-over panel

### 14.2 WebSocket Reconnection Logic

- [x] **Frontend** (`frontend/src/store/websocketStore.ts`) — implement exponential backoff reconnection: attempt after 1 s, 2 s, 4 s, 8 s, max 30 s; cap total attempts at 10 before showing manual reconnect prompt
- [x] Show non-intrusive reconnection banner ("Reconnecting…") during disconnection; dismiss automatically on successful reconnect
- [x] On reconnect, re-subscribe to all active WebSocket topics and replay any missed events from a server-side event buffer (Redis list, last 100 events per client, 60 s TTL)
- [x] **Backend** — add `GET /ws/replay?since=<timestamp>` endpoint to serve buffered events; integrate with existing `manager.broadcast`

### 14.3 Global Frontend Error Boundaries

- [x] Create `ErrorBoundary.tsx` — React class component implementing `componentDidCatch`; renders a styled fallback UI with "Retry" button and collapsible error details
- [x] Wrap every route-level page component in `ErrorBoundary` (update `App.tsx` router)
- [x] Add per-widget `ErrorBoundary` around all dashboard cards so one widget failure does not crash the page
- [x] Send caught errors to backend `POST /frontend/errors` endpoint (new route); log to `AuditLog` with category `SYSTEM`; display count in `MonitoringPage.tsx` error feed

---

## Phase 15: Platform Hardening & Admin 🔮

**Goal:** Close remaining security, observability, and operational gaps.

### 15.1 Audit Trail for Privilege Escalations

- [ ] **Backend** — on every `PATCH /users/{id}/role` or capability grant call, write an `AuditLog` entry with `category = SECURITY`, `level = WARNING`, capturing `actor_id`, `target_user_id`, `old_role`, `new_role`, `expires_at`, `ip_address`
- [ ] Add `GET /audit/privilege-escalations` route: paginated, filterable by `actor_id`, `target_id`, date range
- [ ] **Frontend** — add "Privilege Escalation Log" tab to `RBACManagement.tsx`; table with actor, target, role change delta, timestamp, expiry; export to CSV button

### 15.2 Real-Time MCP Tool Stats & Sub-Second Revocation

- [ ] **Backend** — track per-tool invocation count, average latency, last-used timestamp, error rate in a Redis hash (`agentium:mcp:stats:{tool_id}`) updated on every invocation in `audit_tool_invocation()`
- [ ] `GET /mcp-tools/stats` — return live stats for all tools from Redis (not DB); response time < 50 ms
- [ ] Revocation path: on `revoke_mcp_tool(tool_id)`, write to Redis SET `agentium:mcp:revoked` with no TTL; check this set before every invocation in `get_approved_tools()` — eliminates DB roundtrip, achieving < 1 s revocation
- [ ] **Frontend** — extend `ToolRegistry.tsx`: add stats columns (invocations / avg latency / error rate) to the tool table; live-update via WebSocket event `mcp_stats_update` (emit every 30 s from Celery beat)

### 15.3 Channel Health Monitoring, Logs & Settings

- [ ] **Backend** — `GET /channels/{id}/health` — return: connection status, last message timestamp, error count (last 24 h), circuit breaker state, rate limit utilization
- [ ] `GET /channels/{id}/logs` — paginated `ExternalMessage` history with filters for `status`, `sender_id`, date range
- [ ] `PATCH /channels/{id}/settings` — update per-channel rate limit, auto-create-tasks flag, default agent assignment, content filters
- [ ] Celery beat every 5 min: emit `channel_health_update` WebSocket event for all active channels
- [ ] **Frontend** — build full channel management UI in `ChannelsPage.tsx`:
  - Health tab: status badge, last message time, error count, circuit breaker indicator per channel
  - Logs tab: scrollable message history with status filtering and sender search
  - Settings tab: rate limit slider, auto-task toggle, default agent dropdown, content filter keyword list

### 15.4 Speaker Identification for Voice System

- [ ] **Backend** — extend `audio.py`: on each audio chunk, run speaker embedding extraction (use `pyannote.audio` speaker diarization or a lightweight ECAPA-TDNN model); map embedding to registered speaker profile in `speaker_profiles` DB table
- [ ] New `speaker_profiles` table: `id`, `user_id` (FK nullable), `name`, `embedding` (float array stored as JSONB), `created_at`
- [ ] `POST /audio/speakers/register` — enroll a new speaker from an audio sample; compute and store embedding
- [ ] `GET /audio/speakers` — list registered speaker profiles
- [ ] On identification, attach `speaker_id` to incoming `ExternalMessage` before routing to agent; include in task context
- [ ] **Frontend** — add "Speaker Profiles" section to voice settings; "Register Voice" button with microphone recording UI; list of enrolled speakers with delete option

---

## Phase 16: Database & Advanced AI Logic 🔮

**Goal:** Optimize data layer performance and deepen AI reasoning capabilities.

### 16.1 Database Connection Pool Tuning & Slow Query Logging

- [ ] **Connection Pool Tuning** — configure `pool_size`, `max_overflow`, `pool_timeout`, `pool_recycle` in `backend/core/database.py` based on expected concurrency (start: `pool_size=20, max_overflow=10, pool_recycle=1800`)
- [ ] Add `pool_pre_ping=True` to main app engine (already done for Celery engine — replicate)
- [ ] **Slow Query Logging** — enable PostgreSQL `log_min_duration_statement = 500` via `docker-compose.yml` command args; parse logs in a Celery task and write summaries to `AuditLog` with category `SYSTEM`
- [ ] Add `GET /admin/slow-queries` endpoint: return top 20 slowest queries from last 24 h, aggregated from PG `pg_stat_statements` view
- [ ] **Frontend** — add "Slow Queries" tab to `MonitoringPage.tsx`: table of query hash, call count, avg duration, last seen; link to explain plan documentation

### 16.2 Learning Decay for Outdated Knowledge Patterns

- [ ] **Backend** — extend `rag_service.py`: add `decay_score` (float, default 1.0) to ChromaDB metadata on every `task_learnings` document
- [ ] Weekly Celery beat task `decay-learnings`: for each document, compute age in days since `last_validated_at`; apply `decay_score = max(0.1, decay_score × 0.95 ^ days_since_validation)` for documents older than 30 days
- [ ] Modify `query_similar()` to multiply cosine similarity by `decay_score` before ranking, so stale knowledge naturally sinks below fresh knowledge
- [ ] When a task completes successfully and a learning was retrieved, reset `last_validated_at = utcnow()` and `decay_score = min(1.0, decay_score + 0.1)` — validation boosts confidence

### 16.3 Cross-Document Citation Graph for RAG

- [ ] **Backend** — on every RAG retrieval, record `{ source_doc_id, cited_by_doc_id, task_id, timestamp }` to a PostgreSQL `citation_edges` table (Migration 010)
- [ ] `GET /knowledge/citation-graph?root={doc_id}&depth={n}` — return graph as `{ nodes, edges }` BFS-traversed up to depth `n` (default 2)
- [ ] Use citation frequency to boost `query_similar()` ranking: documents cited more often receive a `citation_boost` multiplier (cap at 1.3×)
- [ ] **Frontend** — add "Citation Graph" tab to knowledge management page (or constitution page): force-directed D3 graph; click node to expand one more hop; node size = citation frequency

### 16.4 Git Versioning Backups for Config Files

- [ ] **Backend** — new service `backend/services/config_versioning.py`: on any write to constitution articles, model configs, plugin configs, or channel settings, commit a snapshot to a bare Git repo at `/data/config-repo`
- [ ] Use `gitpython` library; commit message format: `[auto] {entity_type}/{entity_id} updated by {actor_id} at {timestamp}`
- [ ] `GET /admin/config-history/{entity_type}/{entity_id}` — return list of Git commits for that entity
- [ ] `POST /admin/config-restore/{entity_type}/{entity_id}?commit={sha}` — restore entity to a specific commit's snapshot (admin only)
- [ ] Mount `/data/config-repo` as a named Docker volume in `docker-compose.yml` for persistence across container restarts

---

## Phase 17: DevSecOps & Polish 🔮

**Goal:** Harden the application against abuse, and elevate the UI to production-quality across all surfaces.

### 17.1 Application-Layer DDoS Hardening

- [ ] **Rate Limiting Enhancement** — move from IP-only rate limiting to layered limits: per-IP (existing), per-user (authenticated), per-endpoint category (auth endpoints stricter than read endpoints)
- [ ] Add `slowapi` (or custom FastAPI middleware) for endpoint-specific limits: `POST /auth/*` → 5 req/min; `POST /tasks` → 30 req/min; general API → 200 req/min
- [ ] **Payload Size Limits** — enforce max request body size (default 1 MB) via FastAPI middleware; separate larger limit for file upload endpoints
- [ ] **Suspicious Pattern Detection** — Celery beat every 5 min: query request logs for IPs with > 100 4xx responses in 5 min → auto-add to Redis blocklist (`agentium:blocked:ips`) with 1 h TTL
- [ ] Nginx config (`nginx.conf`): add `limit_req_zone` and `limit_conn_zone` directives as a first line of defense before FastAPI
- [ ] `GET /admin/blocked-ips` — list currently blocked IPs with TTL; `DELETE /admin/blocked-ips/{ip}` — manual unblock

### 17.2 System-Wide UI Polish

- [ ] **Dark Mode Consistency** — audit all pages for hardcoded `bg-white`, `text-black`, `border-gray-*` without `dark:` variants; replace with semantic tokens using the existing dark mode system
- [ ] **Animations & Transitions** — add `transition-all duration-200` to all interactive elements (buttons, cards, modals, dropdowns) where missing; add skeleton loading states to all data-fetching components that don't already have them
- [ ] **Empty States** — design and implement empty state illustrations/messages for: agent list (no agents), task list (no tasks), inbox (no messages), knowledge base (no documents), workflow list (no workflows)
- [ ] **Toast Notifications** — standardize success/error/info toasts across all forms (currently inconsistent between pages); use a single shared `useToast()` hook
- [ ] **Loading Consistency** — replace all ad-hoc `Loader2` spinners with a unified `<LoadingSpinner size="sm|md|lg" />` component

### 17.3 Mobile Responsiveness for Complex Pages

- [ ] Audit breakpoints for: `TasksPage.tsx`, `AgentTree.tsx`, `VotingPage.tsx`, `MonitoringPage.tsx`, `ConstitutionPage.tsx` — all currently desktop-first
- [ ] `TasksPage.tsx` — collapse table view to card view below `md:` breakpoint; slide-over for task details instead of inline expansion
- [ ] `AgentTree.tsx` — horizontal scroll for deep hierarchies on mobile; collapsible tier groups
- [ ] `VotingPage.tsx` — stack vote cards vertically on mobile; move amendment diff to expandable accordion
- [ ] `MonitoringPage.tsx` — stack metric cards to 1-column grid below `sm:`; health rings resize to 40px
- [ ] New `WorkflowDesigner.tsx` (Phase 13.5) — canvas uses touch events (`onTouchStart/Move/End`) for drag-and-drop on tablet; view-only mode on phone

### 17.4 Accessibility (ARIA Labels & Keyboard Navigation)

- [ ] **ARIA Labels** — audit all icon-only buttons (pencil, trash, settings gear, expand/collapse) and add `aria-label` attributes; audit all form inputs for associated `<label>` elements
- [ ] **Keyboard Navigation** — ensure all interactive elements are reachable via Tab; add `focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500` to all focusable elements that are missing it; modals should trap focus while open (`focus-trap-react` or custom)
- [ ] **Screen Reader** — add `role="status"` and `aria-live="polite"` to real-time updating regions (task status, WebSocket event feed, vote tallies); add `role="alert"` to error messages
- [ ] **Color Contrast** — run `axe-core` or `lighthouse --accessibility` audit; fix all elements below WCAG AA ratio (4.5:1 for text, 3:1 for UI components)
- [ ] Add `skipToContent` link as the first focusable element on every page

## Known Issues & Technical Debt

**High Priority (actively blocking)**

- [ ] `auto_scale_check` Celery task only logs scaling intent — does not actually call `AgentLifecycleService.spawn_agent()` — agents are never auto-spawned
- [ ] WebSocket reconnection logic lacks exponential backoff; clients disconnect permanently on transient network issues
- [ ] Frontend has no global error boundaries — one crashing component brings down the full page

**Medium Priority**

- [ ] Browser task live screenshot stream UI not built (route exists, frontend viewer missing)
- [ ] Checkpoint diff view (branch comparison) not built
- [ ] Channel health monitoring, logs, and settings UI incomplete
- [ ] Speaker identification not production-ready (framework in place, model not integrated)

**Low Priority**

- [ ] UI dark mode inconsistencies on newer pages (Workflows, Events pages not yet built)
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness gaps on complex pages (Tasks, Voting, Monitoring)
- [ ] Accessibility audit not done (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, color contrast)
- [ ] PostgreSQL slow query logging not enabled
- [ ] Connection pool sizes set to defaults — not tuned for production load
- [ ] Config files not version-controlled via Git
