- `OutputCritic` (5xxxx) - Validates against user intent
- `PlanCritic` (6xxxx) - Validates execution DAG soundness

**Key Principle:** Critics operate OUTSIDE democratic chain

- Don't vote on amendments
- Have ABSOLUTE veto authority
- When critic rejects, task retries WITHIN same team
- No Council escalation on critic rejection

**Implementation Plan:**

**New Files to Create:**

- [ ] `backend/models/entities/critics.py` - Critic agent models
- [ ] `backend/services/critic_agents.py` - Critic logic
- [ ] `backend/api/routes/critics.py` - Critic endpoints

**Database Changes:**

```python
class CritiqueReview(BaseEntity):
    task_id: str
    critic_type: str  # "code", "output", "plan"

    retry_count: int
    max_retries: int = 5
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Critics can veto outputs independently
- [ ] Rejected tasks retry without Council replanning
- [ ] Maximum 5 retries before escalation to Council
- [ ] Critic decisions logged in audit trail
- [ ] Critics use different AI models than executors (orthogonal failure modes)

### 6.3 Pre-Declared Acceptance Criteria 🆕 (PENDING - HIGH PRIORITY)

**Implementation:**

- [ ] Add `acceptance_criteria` JSON field to task proposals
- [ ] Council votes on BOTH plan AND success criteria
- [ ] Store as structured, machine-validatable JSON

**Database Migration:**

```python
# Add to existing Task model (non-breaking)
class Task:
    # ... existing fields ...
    acceptance_criteria: Optional[JSON] = None  # NEW
    veto_authority: Optional[str] = None  # Which critic validates
```

**Criterion Structure:**

```python
class AcceptanceCriterion:
    metric: str  # "sql_syntax_valid", "result_schema_matches"
    threshold: Any  # Expected value or range
    validator: str  # Which critic agent validates
    is_mandatory: bool
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] All new tasks require explicit acceptance criteria

- [ ] Human-readable criteria displayed in dashboard
- [ ] Criteria stored in task metadata

### 6.4 Context Ray Tracing - Selective Information Flow 🆕 (PENDING)

**File:** `backend/services/message_bus.py` (Enhancement)

**Problem:** Current system shares full context across all agents
**Solution:** Role-based context visibility

**Message Visibility Controls:**

- **Planners** (Head/Council): User intent, constraints, high-level goals
- **Executors** (Lead/Task): Step-by-step plan, prior step outputs ONLY
- **Critics** (4xxxx/5xxxx/6xxxx): Execution results + acceptance criteria ONLY
- **Siblings**: NO visibility into each other's work

**Enhanced Message Schema:**

```python
class AgentMessage:
    content: str
    visible_to: List[str]  # Agent ID patterns: ["2*", "3*"]
    message_type: str  # "PLAN", "EXECUTION", "CRITIQUE"
    context_scope: str  # "FULL", "SUMMARY", "SCHEMA_ONLY"  # NEW
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**

    session_id: str
    phase: str  # "plan_approved", "execution_complete", "critique_passed"
    agent_states: JSON  # Dict[agent_id, AgentState]
    artifacts: List[str]  # Generated outputs
    parent_checkpoint_id: Optional[str]  # For branching
    is_active: bool
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**

### 6.6 Remote Code Execution (Brains vs Hands) 🆕 (PENDING - CRITICAL)

**Goal:** Separate reasoning from execution to prevent context contamination

**New Service:** `backend/services/remote_executor/` (Docker container)

**Architecture:**

```
Agent (Brain) → Writes Code → Remote Executor (Hands) → Returns Summary
     ↑                                                    ↓
     └────────────── Receives Summary ←───────────────────┘
```

**Key Principle:** Raw data NEVER enters agent context

**Implementation:**

```python
class RemoteCodeExecutor:
    def execute(self, code: str, context: ExecutionContext) -> ExecutionSummary:
        # Runs in isolated Docker container
        raw_result = self.run_in_sandbox(code)

        # Returns ONLY what agent needs to know
        return ExecutionSummary(
            schema=raw_result.schema,
            row_count=len(raw_result),
            sample=raw_result.head(3),  # Small preview
            stats=raw_result.describe(),
            # NEVER returns full raw data
        )
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Raw data never enters agent context window
- [ ] Agents reason about data shape, not content
- [ ] PII stays in execution layer
- [ ] Working set size >> context window size
- [ ] Code execution fully sandboxed (Docker isolation)
- [ ] Resource limits enforced (CPU, memory, time)

## Research Paper Integration Summary

**Key Insights from "If You Want Coherence, Orchestrate a Team of Rivals"**

### ✅ Already Implemented

1. **Hierarchical Structure** - 0xxxx/1xxxx/2xxxx/3xxxx agent tiers
2. **Democratic Voting** - Council deliberation and voting
3. **Constitutional Law** - Agents bound by shared rules

### 🆕 Critical Additions Needed

4. **Pre-Declared Acceptance Criteria** - Define success BEFORE work starts
5. **Specialized Critics with Veto** - Opposing forces to catch errors
6. **Context Isolation** - Prevent contamination across execution branches
7. **Remote Code Execution** - Separate reasoning from execution
8. **Checkpointing** - Time-travel recovery and branching
9. **Orthogonal Failure Modes** - Force model diversity (different providers)
10. **Structured Handoffs** - Type-safe inter-agent communication

### The Biggest Gap

**Current:** Democratic voting seeks consensus
**Needed:** Veto authority enforces boundaries

**Research shows:** Consensus voting lets errors through; veto authority catches them.

**Migration Strategy:** All additions are NON-BREAKING

- New agent types (4xxxx/5xxxx/6xxxx)
- New services (checkpoint, remote executor)
- Enhanced existing services (message bus, constitutional guard)
- Existing voting system remains intact
- Critics operate in PARALLEL to hierarchy

# ✅ Final Verification & System Checklist

## 0. Rough Ideas (What to do and What to check)

1. Multi-Channel Integration (Messaging Platforms)
   Add support for WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, Signal, Google Chat, iMessage, Microsoft Teams, Zalo, and Matrix to enable local-first AI agents across communication platforms.
   Priority order:
   Easy: Telegram, Discord, Slack (API-first)
   Moderate: WhatsApp (Baileys), Signal (signal-cli), Google Chat, Matrix
   Hard: iMessage (macOS only), Microsoft Teams (enterprise complexity), Zalo (limited API)
   Architecture: Map each channel to Task Agents (3xxxx) under a "Communications Council" Lead Agent (2xxxx).

2. Idle Task Deduplication (Critical Bug)
   Prevent duplicate idle optimization tasks from spawning. Currently seeing 20+ identical tasks ("Vector Maintenance", "Cache Optimization", "Storage Dedupe", "Audit Archival") running simultaneously.
   Root cause: No uniqueness check before task creation.
   Solution: Implement idempotency key or status check before spawning idle tasks.

## 1. Access & Permissions

- Verify that the **Head of Council** has full system access.
- Verify **Browser Control** functionality.

## 2. System Testing

- Perform complete system testing.
- Ensure all modules and workflows are functioning correctly.

## 3. Memory Management

### Database & Vector Database

- Implement proper memory management.
- Delete very old data records and outdated data versions.
- **Do NOT delete the original constitution.**

### Additional Requirements

- Tools to connect to the MCP server.
- Automatic fallback system:
  - Switch to the next available API key if the current API key fails.
- Send notifications if **none of the API keys** respond:
  - In the frontend.
  - In running/background channels.

## 4. Ethos & Message History Management

- Verify that message history is stored and accessed correctly.
- The message history represents the **Ethos** and must:
  - Be updated
  - Be editable
  - Be minimized/summarized for efficiency

### Ethos Update Workflow

1. Read the Constitution.
2. Update individual Ethos.
3. While working:
   - Log what the agent is doing.
   - Log what has been completed.
   - Log what remains.
4. Apply this workflow to all agents.

## 5. API Request Validation

- Ensure that the **Ethos content is always included** in every API request.
