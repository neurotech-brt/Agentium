### 5.4 API Key Resilience & Notification System 🆕 (PENDING)

**File:** `backend/services/api_key_manager.py` (new)

**Goal:** Ensure zero-downtime model access with intelligent failover and user notification when all keys fail.

**Inspired by:** Rowboat's API key fallback pattern — formalized into Agentium's governance model.

**Failover Architecture:**

```
Request → Primary Key (OpenAI)
    ↓ FAIL
    → Secondary Key (Anthropic)
    ↓ FAIL
    → Tertiary Key (Groq)
    ↓ FAIL
    → Local Fallback (Ollama)
    ↓ FAIL
    → ALERT: Notify all channels + frontend
```

**Features:**

- [x] `get_active_key()` - Returns next healthy key in priority order
- [x] `mark_key_failed(key_id, error)` - Temporarily disables a key with backoff
- [x] `recover_key(key_id)` - Auto-retry failed keys after cooldown period
- [x] `notify_all_keys_down()` - Broadcasts to frontend WebSocket + all active channels
- [x] `get_key_health_report()` - Provider status dashboard data
- [x] Cost budget enforcement per key (prevent overspend)
- [x] API key rotation without service downtime

**Notification Targets When All Keys Fail:**

- [x] Frontend dashboard: Red alert banner with affected providers
- [x] WebSocket broadcast to all connected clients
- [x] All active channels (Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp) get fallback message
- [x] Email alert to Sovereign (if configured)

**Database Model:**

```python
class APIKeyRecord(BaseEntity):
    provider: str           # "openai", "anthropic", "groq"
    key_hash: str           # Hashed for security
    priority: int           # 1=primary, 2=secondary, etc.
    status: str             # "active", "failed", "rate_limited", "exhausted"
    failure_count: int
    last_failure_at: Optional[datetime]
    cooldown_until: Optional[datetime]

- `CodeCritic` (4xxxx) - Validates code syntax, security, logic
- `OutputCritic` (5xxxx) - Validates against user intent
- `PlanCritic` (6xxxx) - Validates execution DAG soundness

**Key Principle:** Critics operate OUTSIDE democratic chain

- Don't vote on amendments
- Have ABSOLUTE veto authority
- When critic rejects, task retries WITHIN same team
- No Council escalation on critic rejection

**Implementation Plan:**

**New Files to Create:**

- [x] `backend/models/entities/critics.py` - Critic agent models
- [x] `backend/services/critic_agents.py` - Critic logic
- [x] `backend/api/routes/critics.py` - Critic endpoints

**Database Changes:**

```python
class CritiqueReview(BaseEntity):
    task_id: str
    critic_type: str  # "code", "output", "plan"
    critic_agentium_id: str
    verdict: str  # "PASS", "REJECT", "ESCALATE"
    rejection_reason: Optional[str]
    retry_count: int
    max_retries: int = 5
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [x] Critics can veto outputs independently
- [x] Rejected tasks retry without Council replanning
- [x] Maximum 5 retries before escalation to Council
- [x] Critic decisions logged in audit trail
- [x] Critics use different AI models than executors (orthogonal failure modes)

### 6.3 Pre-Declared Acceptance Criteria 🆕 ✅

**Goal:** Define success criteria BEFORE work begins

**Implementation:**

- [x] Add `acceptance_criteria` JSON field to task proposals
- [x] Council votes on BOTH plan AND success criteria
- [x] Store as structured, machine-validatable JSON

**Database Migration:**

```python
# Added to existing Task model (non-breaking)
class Task:
    # ... existing fields ...
    acceptance_criteria = Column(JSON, nullable=True)  # ✅
    veto_authority = Column(String(20), nullable=True)  # ✅
```

**Criterion Structure:**

```python
@dataclass
class AcceptanceCriterion:
    metric: str  # "sql_syntax_valid", "result_schema_matches"
    threshold: Any  # Expected value or range
    validator: CriterionValidator  # code | output | plan
    is_mandatory: bool = True
    description: str = ""
```

**Implementation Details:**

- ✅ `acceptance_criteria.py` — `AcceptanceCriterion`, `CriterionResult`, `AcceptanceCriteriaService`
- ✅ `AcceptanceCriteriaService.parse_and_validate()` — validates raw JSON from API
- ✅ `AcceptanceCriteriaService.evaluate_criteria()` — rule-based checks (sql_syntax, result_not_empty, length, contains, boolean, generic)
- ✅ `AcceptanceCriteriaService.aggregate()` — counts + mandatory-failure flag
- ✅ `api/schemas/task.py` — Pydantic `AcceptanceCriterionSchema` with validators (unique metrics, valid validator values)
- ✅ `api/routes/tasks.py` — validates + stores on create and update, veto_authority validation
- ✅ `critic_agents.py` — loads criteria from Task, runs deterministic checks before AI review, fast-rejects on mandatory failures
- ✅ `CritiqueReview` entity stores `criteria_results`, `criteria_evaluated`, `criteria_passed`
- ✅ DB migration (`001_schema.py`) includes `acceptance_criteria` column

**Tests:** ✅ 42 unit tests in `backend/tests/test_acceptance_criteria.py` (all passing)

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [x] All new tasks require explicit acceptance criteria
- [x] Criteria are machine-validatable where possible
- [x] Human-readable criteria displayed in dashboard
- [x] Criteria stored in task metadata

### 6.4 Context Ray Tracing - Selective Information Flow 🆕 ✅

**File:** `backend/services/message_bus.py` (Enhancement) ✅

**Problem:** Current system shares full context across all agents
**Solution:** Role-based context visibility via `ContextRayTracer` class

**Message Visibility Controls:**

- ✅ **Planners** (Head/Council): User intent, constraints, high-level goals
- ✅ **Executors** (Lead/Task): Step-by-step plan, prior step outputs ONLY
- ✅ **Critics** (4xxxx/5xxxx/6xxxx): Execution results + acceptance criteria ONLY
- ✅ **Siblings**: NO visibility into each other's work (via `visible_to` patterns)

**Enhanced Message Schema:**

```python
class AgentMessage:
    content: str
    visible_to: List[str]  # Agent ID patterns: ["2*", "3*"]
    message_type: str  # "plan", "execution", "critique", "critique_result"
    context_scope: str  # "FULL", "SUMMARY", "SCHEMA_ONLY"
```

**Implementation Details:**

- ✅ `ContextRayTracer` class in `message_bus.py` (stateless, all `@classmethod`)
- ✅ `get_agent_role()` — maps prefix → PLANNER / EXECUTOR / CRITIC
- ✅ `is_visible_to()` — dual check: glob pattern match + role-based type filter
- ✅ `filter_messages()` — filters + applies `context_scope` automatically
- ✅ `apply_scope()` — FULL / SUMMARY (truncate to 200 chars) / SCHEMA_ONLY
- ✅ `build_context()` — convenience wrapper for filter + scope
- ✅ Schema extended: `visible_to`, `context_scope`, critic IDs (4-6), new message types
- ✅ `HierarchyValidator` extended with critic tiers 4/5/6
- ✅ Wired into `consume_stream()` for automatic filtering on message consumption

**Tests:** ✅ 57 unit tests in `backend/tests/test_context_ray_tracing.py` (all passing)

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [x] Agents only receive context relevant to their role
- [x] Sibling task isolation enforced
- [x] Context window optimization (reduced token usage)
- [x] No cross-contamination between execution branches


### 6.5 Checkpointing & Time-Travel Recovery 🆕 (PENDING)

**New File:** `backend/services/checkpoint_service.py`

**Purpose:** Enable session resumption and retry from any point

**Implementation:**

- [ ] Serialize complete system state after each phase
- [ ] Store in PostgreSQL with versioning
- [ ] Allow "time travel" to any checkpoint
- [ ] Support branching (try different approaches from same checkpoint)

**Database Model:**

```python
class ExecutionCheckpoint(BaseEntity):
    session_id: str
    phase: str  # "plan_approved", "execution_complete", "critique_passed"
    agent_states: JSON  # Dict[agent_id, AgentState]
    artifacts: List[str]  # Generated outputs
    parent_checkpoint_id: Optional[str]  # For branching
    is_active: bool
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Checkpoints created automatically at phase boundaries
- [ ] Users can resume sessions after days/weeks
- [ ] Retry from any checkpoint with different parameters
- [ ] Complete audit trail of checkpoint transitions
- [ ] Checkpoint cleanup (auto-delete after 90 days)

### 6.6 Remote Code Execution (Brains vs Hands) 🆕 (PENDING - CRITICAL)

**Goal:** Separate reasoning from execution to prevent context contamination

**New Service:** `backend/services/remote_executor/` (Docker container)

**Architecture:**

```
Agent (Brain) → Writes Code → Remote Executor (Hands) → Returns Summary
     ↑                                                    ↓
     └────────────── Receives Summary ←───────────────────┘
```

**Key Principle:** Raw data NEVER enters agent context

**Implementation:**

```python
class RemoteCodeExecutor:
    def execute(self, code: str, context: ExecutionContext) -> ExecutionSummary:
        # Runs in isolated Docker container
        raw_result = self.run_in_sandbox(code)

        # Returns ONLY what agent needs to know
        return ExecutionSummary(
            schema=raw_result.schema,
            row_count=len(raw_result),
            sample=raw_result.head(3),  # Small preview
            stats=raw_result.describe(),
            # NEVER returns full raw data
        )
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Raw data never enters agent context window
- [ ] Agents reason about data shape, not content
- [ ] PII stays in execution layer
- [ ] Working set size >> context window size
- [ ] Code execution fully sandboxed (Docker isolation)
- [ ] Resource limits enforced (CPU, memory, time)

**Docker Service:**

- [ ] Create `docker-compose.remote-executor.yml`
- [ ] Separate network isolation
- [ ] Limited resource allocation
- [ ] Auto-restart on failure

### 6.7 MCP Server Integration with Constitutional Governance 🆕 (PENDING)

**File:** `backend/services/mcp_governance.py` (new)

**Goal:** Extend the existing Tool Creation Service (6.1) to support MCP servers as a tool source, with constitutional tier-based approval and audit logging on every invocation.

**Inspired by:** Rowboat's native MCP support — adapted into Agentium's democratic approval model.

**Philosophy:** Rowboat connects MCP tools directly. Agentium connects them through the Constitution.

**Tool Tier System:**

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                 MCP TOOL REGISTRY                    │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Tier 1: Pre-Approved (Council vote to USE)          │
│  ├─ Safe read-only APIs (weather, public data)       │
│  └─ Non-destructive queries                          │
│                                                      │
│  Tier 2: Restricted (Head approval per use)          │
│  ├─ Email sending                                    │
│  ├─ File system writes                               │
│  └─ External webhooks                                │
│                                                      │
│  Tier 3: Forbidden (Constitutionally banned)         │
│  ├─ Financial transactions                           │
│  ├─ Credential/password access                       │
│  └─ Raw shell execution (use Remote Executor 6.6)   │

**Integration with Existing 6.1 Tool Creation Service:**

MCP tools enter the same approval pipeline as agent-created tools. The only difference is the source — MCP server vs agent-generated code. Constitutional Guard (2.3) audits every invocation.

**Database Model:**

```python
class MCPTool(BaseEntity):
    name: str
    description: str
    server_url: str
    tier: str                          # "pre_approved", "restricted", "forbidden"
    capabilities: List[str]
    constitutional_article: Optional[str]  # Which article governs this
    approved_by_council: bool = False
    approval_vote_id: Optional[str]
    usage_count: int = 0
    last_used_at: Optional[datetime]
    audit_log: List[Dict]              # Every invocation logged
```

**Implementation:**

- [ ] `backend/services/mcp_governance.py` - Core MCP client + constitutional wrapper
- [ ] `propose_mcp_server(url, description)` - Council member proposes new MCP server
- [ ] `audit_tool_invocation(tool_id, agent_id, action)` - Constitutional Guard hook
- [ ] `get_approved_tools(agent_tier)` - Returns tools accessible to agent's tier
- [ ] `revoke_mcp_tool(tool_id, reason)` - Emergency revocation without vote
- [ ] MCP tool wrapper auto-generates constitutional compliance layer

**Frontend:**

- [ ] `frontend/src/components/mcp/ToolRegistry.tsx` - Browse available MCP tools
- [ ] Filter by tier, approval status, usage stats
- [ ] "Propose new MCP server" modal → triggers Council vote
- [ ] Per-tool invocation audit log viewer

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Every MCP tool invocation logged in audit trail with agent_id, timestamp, input hash
- [ ] Tier 3 tools blocked at Constitutional Guard before reaching MCP client
- [ ] Tier 2 tools require Head approval token in request
- [ ] Council vote required to add any new MCP server (same flow as 6.1)
- [ ] Tool registry shows real-time usage stats per tool
- [ ] Revoked tools immediately unavailable (cache invalidation <1s)
- [ ] MCP server health monitored (auto-disable on repeated failures)

**Python Dependencies to Add:**

```
mcp==1.0.0    # Official MCP Python SDK
```

## Phase 12: Agentium SDK & External Interface 🔌 (FUTURE)

**Goal:** Allow external systems and developers to interact with Agentium programmatically, with all governance and constitutional constraints preserved in every external call.

**Inspired by:** Rowboat's Python SDK pattern — rebuilt with Agentium's constitutional context baked in.

**Philosophy:** External callers get the power of Agentium, but never bypass its Constitution.

### 12.1 Python SDK

**Package:** `sdk/python/agentium/`

**Core Interface:**

```python
from agentium import SovereignClient, StatefulSession

client = SovereignClient(
    host="http://localhost:8000",
    api_key="<SOVEREIGN_API_KEY>",
    constitution_version="v1.2.4"   # Pinned — breaks if constitution changes
)

# Start a governed session
session = StatefulSession(client)

# Submit a task — routes through full hierarchy
response = session.delegate(
    task="Analyze Q3 reports and summarize findings",
    constraints={
        "max_cost_usd": 5.00,
        "privacy_level": "internal",
        "allowed_tiers": ["2xxxx", "3xxxx"]
    },
    acceptance_criteria={
        "format": "markdown",
        "max_length_words": 1000,
        "critic_validation": True
    }
)

# Response includes full governance trail
print(response.result)
print(response.constitutional_checks_passed)
print(response.critic_reviews)
print(response.audit_trail)
print(response.cost_usd)
```

**Features:**

- [ ] `SovereignClient` - Authenticated connection with constitution version pinning
- [ ] `StatefulSession` - Maintains conversation context across multiple calls
- [ ] `delegate(task, constraints, acceptance_criteria)` - Full governed task submission
- [ ] `get_audit_trail(session_id)` - Retrieve complete decision log
- [ ] `get_constitution(version)` - Fetch active or historical constitution
- [ ] `propose_amendment(diff)` - Trigger amendment workflow from SDK
- [ ] `list_agents(tier)` - Browse agent hierarchy
- [ ] Streaming support for long-running tasks
- [ ] Async/await support

**Files:**

- [ ] `sdk/python/agentium/__init__.py`
- [ ] `sdk/python/agentium/client.py`
- [ ] `sdk/python/agentium/session.py`
- [ ] `sdk/python/agentium/models.py`
- [ ] `sdk/python/agentium/exceptions.py`
- [ ] `sdk/python/README.md`
- [ ] `sdk/python/setup.py`

### 12.2 TypeScript SDK

**Package:** `sdk/typescript/`

**Core Interface:**

```typescript
import { AgentiumClient, StatefulSession } from "@agentium/sdk";

const client = new AgentiumClient({
  host: "http://localhost:8000",
  apiKey: process.env.AGENTIUM_KEY,
});

const session = new StatefulSession(client);
const response = await session.delegate({
  task: "Draft a response to this customer complaint",
  constraints: { privacyLevel: "internal" },
});
```

**Files:**

- [ ] `sdk/typescript/src/client.ts`
- [ ] `sdk/typescript/src/session.ts`
- [ ] `sdk/typescript/src/types.ts`
- [ ] `sdk/typescript/package.json`
- [ ] `sdk/typescript/README.md`

### 12.3 SDK Governance Rules

**What SDK callers CAN do:**

- [ ] Submit tasks (routed through full hierarchy)
- [ ] Query agent status and audit trail
- [ ] Propose amendments (triggers vote, doesn't bypass it)
- [ ] Read constitution and knowledge base
- [ ] Stream task progress events

**What SDK callers CANNOT do:**

- [ ] Bypass Constitutional Guard
- [ ] Skip critic validation
- [ ] Access Tier 3 MCP tools directly
- [ ] Impersonate an agent tier above their API key's authorization level
- [ ] Suppress audit logging

**Authentication:**

- [ ] SDK API keys issued per external system (not per user)
- [ ] Keys scoped to specific tiers and capabilities
- [ ] Key usage logged in audit trail like any other agent action
- [ ] Keys revocable via Council vote

### 12.4 Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Python SDK installable via `pip install agentium-sdk`
- [ ] TypeScript SDK installable via `npm install @agentium/sdk`
- [ ] All SDK calls produce identical audit trails to direct API calls
- [ ] Constitution version pinning raises error if version mismatch
- [ ] SDK documentation with working examples for all major use cases

## Research Paper Integration Summary

**Key Insights from "If You Want Coherence, Orchestrate a Team of Rivals"**

### ✅ Already Implemented

1. **Hierarchical Structure** - 0xxxx/1xxxx/2xxxx/3xxxx agent tiers
2. **Democratic Voting** - Council deliberation and voting
3. **Constitutional Law** - Agents bound by shared rules

### 🆕 Critical Additions Needed

4. **Pre-Declared Acceptance Criteria** - Define success BEFORE work starts
5. **Specialized Critics with Veto** - Opposing forces to catch errors
6. **Context Isolation** - Prevent contamination across execution branches
7. **Remote Code Execution** - Separate reasoning from execution
8. **Checkpointing** - Time-travel recovery and branching
9. **Orthogonal Failure Modes** - Force model diversity (different providers)
10. **Structured Handoffs** - Type-safe inter-agent communication

### The Biggest Gap

**Current:** Democratic voting seeks consensus
**Needed:** Veto authority enforces boundaries

**Research shows:** Consensus voting lets errors through; veto authority catches them.

**Migration Strategy:** All additions are NON-BREAKING

- New agent types (4xxxx/5xxxx/6xxxx)
- New services (checkpoint, remote executor)
- Enhanced existing services (message bus, constitutional guard)
- Existing voting system remains intact
- Critics operate in PARALLEL to hierarchy

# ✅ Final Verification & System Checklist

## 0. Rough Ideas (What to do and What to check)

1. Multi-Channel Integration (Messaging Platforms)
   Add support for WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, Signal, Google Chat, iMessage, Microsoft Teams, Zalo, and Matrix to enable local-first AI agents across communication platforms.
   Priority order:
   Easy: Telegram, Discord, Slack (API-first)
   Moderate: WhatsApp (Baileys), Signal (signal-cli), Google Chat, Matrix
   Hard: iMessage (macOS only), Microsoft Teams (enterprise complexity), Zalo (limited API)
   Architecture: Map each channel to Task Agents (3xxxx) under a "Communications Council" Lead Agent (2xxxx).

## 1. Access & Permissions

- Verify that the **Head of Council** has full system access.
- Verify **Browser Control** functionality.

## 2. System Testing

- Perform complete system testing.
- Ensure all modules and workflows are functioning correctly.

## 3. Memory Management

### Database & Vector Database

- Implement proper memory management.
- Delete very old data records and outdated data versions.
- **Do NOT delete the original constitution.**

### Additional Requirements

- Tools to connect to the MCP server.
- Automatic fallback system:
  - Switch to the next available API key if the current API key fails.
- Send notifications if **none of the API keys** respond:
  - In the frontend.
  - In running/background channels.

## 4. Ethos & Message History Management

- Verify that message history is stored and accessed correctly.
- The message history represents the **Ethos** and must:
  - Be updated
  - Be editable
  - Be minimized/summarized for efficiency

### Ethos Update Workflow

1. Read the Constitution.
2. Update individual Ethos.
3. While working:
   - Log what the agent is doing.
   - Log what has been completed.
   - Log what remains.
