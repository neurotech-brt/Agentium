Autonomous Council Loop Implementation Plan
Goal Description
Implement an "Always On" background service where the Head of Council (HoC) and Council Members autonomously monitor the system, even without user interaction. They should "breathe," meaning they periodically check for work, plan, or reflect on the system state.

Proposed Changes
Backend (backend/)
[NEW] services/council_loop.py
Class CouncilLoop.
Method start(): An infinite async loop.
Logic:
Pulse Check: Every 30 seconds.
Load Agents: specific Council Members.
Task Check: Look for pending tasks.
Idle Behavior:
If idle, generate a "System Reflection" or "Status Report".
Use ModelService to generate a thought based on the Constitution.
"Log" this thought (e.g., to a new CouncilLog or reusing AuditLog/ChatHistory).
Active Behavior:
Suggest actions for pending tasks (Simulated for MVP).
[MODIFY] main.py
Initialize CouncilLoop in startup event.
Use asyncio.create_task to run it without blocking.
Frontend (frontend/src)
[MODIFY] pages/Dashboard.tsx
Add a "Council Status" widget showing "Active - Thinking..." or "Active - Monitoring".
Real-time updates via WebSocket (simulated or polling).
Verification Plan
Logs: specific logs in the console showing the loop running.
Database: specific new entries in logs/chats generated by the autonomous agent.
UI: Verify the dashboard shows the "System Pulse".
Since there are no existing frontend tests, I will rely on manual verification for the UI.
Backend tests might exist, but I am focused on frontend implementation.
Manual Verification
Navigation: Click functionality of the "Models" link in the sidebar.
List Providers: Verify that the "Add Model" form lists all supported providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.).
Add Config:
Select "OpenAI".
Enter a dummy (or real if available) API key.
Click "Test Connection". Verify success/error message.
Save. Verify it appears in the list.
Edit Config: Change the default model or temperature. Save. Verify updates.
Set Default: Set a different config as default. Verify the UI updates.
Delete Config: Delete a config. Verify it's removed.
