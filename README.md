# 🏛️ Agentium

> A local-first AI governance platform where AI agents operate like a democratic government

Agentium transforms AI task management into a structured democracy. Your AI system mirrors a government hierarchy: a **Head of Council** (Prime Minister), **Council Members** (Parliament), and **Agents** (civil servants) work together to handle your tasks efficiently and transparently.

It is a fully Dockerized, cross-platform AI system that runs on any computer, offering a complete web-based interface for control, monitoring, and governance, while also supporting command execution through channels like WhatsApp, Telegram, and more using a democratic, council-governed hierarchy of AI agents for safe, auditable automation.

## ✨ What Makes Agentium Special?

**Democratic AI Governance** — Tasks aren't just executed; they're deliberated, voted on, and approved through a multi-tier AI system that ensures accountability.

**Local-First Philosophy** — Run everything on your own hardware with full control over your data and models.

**Intelligent Scaling** — The system automatically spawns new agents and council members as workload increases.

**Universal Access** — Control everything from a sleek web dashboard accessible on any device.

## 🏗️ Architecture

Agentium uses a containerized microservices architecture where each component runs in isolation:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Web Dashboard (React + TypeScript)         │
│  Accessible from any browser/device         │
└──────────────────┬──────────────────────────┘
                   │
┌──────────────────▼──────────────────────────┐
│  API Gateway (FastAPI)                      │
│  WebSocket + REST endpoints                 │
└──────────────────┬──────────────────────────┘
                   │
┌──────────────────▼──────────────────────────┐
│  Head of Council (AI Model)                 │
│  Full access • Decision authority           │
└──────────────────┬──────────────────────────┘
                   │
┌──────────────────▼──────────────────────────┐

│  Voting • Partial access                    │
└──────────────────┬──────────────────────────┘
                   │
┌──────────────────▼──────────────────────────┐
│  Lead Agents (AI Models)                    │
│  Task coordination • Team management        │
└──────────────────┬──────────────────────────┘
                   │

## Internal Documentation

### Constitution
- Begins with a standardized base template.
- Defines the **sovereign preferences** of the system.
- Specifies clear rules on permitted and prohibited actions.
- Updated through voting by Council Members and approved by the Head of Council.
- Constitution should be reviewed and updated daily.
- Read-only for all entities except the Head of Council.

---

### Individual Agent Ethos
- Every Agent possesses its own Ethos.
- The Ethos is created by the Agent’s immediate higher authority using a default template.
- Defines rules governing what the Agent **should** and **should not** do.
- May be updated by the Individual Agent, but must be reviewed and approved by the Lead Agent.
- For Lead Agents, the Ethos is reviewed and updated by the Head of Council.
- Agents may ask questions to their direct leader when clarification is needed.
- Ethos should be reviewed and updated daily.

---

### On Creation
- Each Head of Council, Council Member, Lead Agent, and Task Agent is created with a default Ethos.
- Each Head of Council, Council Member, Lead Agent, and Task Agent must read Constitution and Ethos at creation.
- The Ethos is generated by the Agent’s higher authority using a default template.
- Upon creation, each entity must:
  - Read and acknowledge the Constitution.
  - Read and acknowledge its own Ethos.

---

### Termination
- The Head of Council is never terminated.
- A Council Member is terminated if it violates the Constitution.
- A Lead Agent is terminated if it violates the Constitution.
- A Task Agent is terminated if it violates the Constitution.
- Agents are terminated after completing their assigned tasks.
- Agents are terminated if inactive for more than one week.

---

### Identification
- All Agents are assigned a unique identification number.
- Identifier format:
  - **Head of Council:** `0xxxx`
  - **Council Member:** `1xxxx`
  - **Lead Agent:** `2xxxx`
  - **Task Agent:** `3xxxx`
