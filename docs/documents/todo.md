**Inspired by:** Rowboat's API key fallback pattern — formalized into Agentium's governance model.

**Failover Architecture:**

```
Request → Primary Key (OpenAI)
    ↓ FAIL
    → Secondary Key (Anthropic)
    ↓ FAIL
    → Tertiary Key (Groq)
    ↓ FAIL
    → Local Fallback (Ollama)
    ↓ FAIL
    → ALERT: Notify all channels + frontend
```

**Features:**

- [x] `get_active_key()` - Returns next healthy key in priority order
- [x] `mark_key_failed(key_id, error)` - Temporarily disables a key with backoff
- [x] `recover_key(key_id)` - Auto-retry failed keys after cooldown period
- [x] `notify_all_keys_down()` - Broadcasts to frontend WebSocket + all active channels
- [x] `get_key_health_report()` - Provider status dashboard data
- [x] Cost budget enforcement per key (prevent overspend)
- [x] API key rotation without service downtime

**Notification Targets When All Keys Fail:**

- [x] Frontend dashboard: Red alert banner with affected providers
- [x] WebSocket broadcast to all connected clients

- `PlanCritic` (6xxxx) - Validates execution DAG soundness

**Key Principle:** Critics operate OUTSIDE democratic chain

- Don't vote on amendments
- Have ABSOLUTE veto authority
- When critic rejects, task retries WITHIN same team
- No Council escalation on critic rejection

**Implementation Plan:**

**New Files to Create:**

- [x] `backend/models/entities/critics.py` - Critic agent models
- [x] `backend/services/critic_agents.py` - Critic logic
- [x] `backend/api/routes/critics.py` - Critic endpoints

- [x] Rejected tasks retry without Council replanning
- [x] Maximum 5 retries before escalation to Council
- [x] Critic decisions logged in audit trail
- [x] Critics use different AI models than executors (orthogonal failure modes)

### 6.3 Pre-Declared Acceptance Criteria 🆕 ✅

**Goal:** Define success criteria BEFORE work begins

**Implementation:**

- [x] Add `acceptance_criteria` JSON field to task proposals
- [x] Council votes on BOTH plan AND success criteria
- [x] Store as structured, machine-validatable JSON

**Database Migration:**

```python
# Added to existing Task model (non-breaking)
class Task:
    # ... existing fields ...
    acceptance_criteria = Column(JSON, nullable=True)  # ✅
    veto_authority = Column(String(20), nullable=True)  # ✅
```

**Criterion Structure:**

```python
@dataclass
class AcceptanceCriterion:
    metric: str  # "sql_syntax_valid", "result_schema_matches"
    threshold: Any  # Expected value or range
    validator: CriterionValidator  # code | output | plan
    is_mandatory: bool = True
    description: str = ""
```

**Implementation Details:**

- ✅ `acceptance_criteria.py` — `AcceptanceCriterion`, `CriterionResult`, `AcceptanceCriteriaService`
- ✅ `AcceptanceCriteriaService.parse_and_validate()` — validates raw JSON from API
- ✅ `AcceptanceCriteriaService.evaluate_criteria()` — rule-based checks (sql_syntax, result_not_empty, length, contains, boolean, generic)
- ✅ `AcceptanceCriteriaService.aggregate()` — counts + mandatory-failure flag
- ✅ `api/schemas/task.py` — Pydantic `AcceptanceCriterionSchema` with validators (unique metrics, valid validator values)
- ✅ `api/routes/tasks.py` — validates + stores on create and update, veto_authority validation
- ✅ `critic_agents.py` — loads criteria from Task, runs deterministic checks before AI review, fast-rejects on mandatory failures
- ✅ `CritiqueReview` entity stores `criteria_results`, `criteria_evaluated`, `criteria_passed`
- ✅ DB migration (`001_schema.py`) includes `acceptance_criteria` column

**Tests:** ✅ 42 unit tests in `backend/tests/test_acceptance_criteria.py` (all passing)

- [x] Criteria stored in task metadata

### 6.4 Context Ray Tracing - Selective Information Flow 🆕 ✅

**File:** `backend/services/message_bus.py` (Enhancement) ✅

**Problem:** Current system shares full context across all agents
**Solution:** Role-based context visibility via `ContextRayTracer` class

**Message Visibility Controls:**

- ✅ **Planners** (Head/Council): User intent, constraints, high-level goals
- ✅ **Executors** (Lead/Task): Step-by-step plan, prior step outputs ONLY
- ✅ **Critics** (7xxxx/8xxxx/9xxxx): Execution results + acceptance criteria ONLY
- ✅ **Siblings**: NO visibility into each other's work (via `visible_to` patterns)

**Enhanced Message Schema:**

```python
class AgentMessage:
    content: str
    visible_to: List[str]  # Agent ID patterns: ["2*", "3*"]
    message_type: str  # "plan", "execution", "critique", "critique_result"
    context_scope: str  # "FULL", "SUMMARY", "SCHEMA_ONLY"
```

**Implementation Details:**

- ✅ `ContextRayTracer` class in `message_bus.py` (stateless, all `@classmethod`)
- ✅ `get_agent_role()` — maps prefix → PLANNER / EXECUTOR / CRITIC
- ✅ `is_visible_to()` — dual check: glob pattern match + role-based type filter
- ✅ `filter_messages()` — filters + applies `context_scope` automatically
- ✅ `apply_scope()` — FULL / SUMMARY (truncate to 200 chars) / SCHEMA_ONLY
- ✅ `build_context()` — convenience wrapper for filter + scope
- ✅ Schema extended: `visible_to`, `context_scope`, critic IDs (4-6), new message types
- ✅ `HierarchyValidator` extended with critic tiers 4/5/6
- ✅ Wired into `consume_stream()` for automatic filtering on message consumption

**Tests:** ✅ 57 unit tests in `backend/tests/test_context_ray_tracing.py` (all passing)

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [x] Agents only receive context relevant to their role
- [x] Sibling task isolation enforced
- [x] Context window optimization (reduced token usage)
- [x] No cross-contamination between execution branches

### 6.5 Checkpointing & Time-Travel Recovery 🆕 (COMPLETE)

class ExecutionCheckpoint(BaseEntity):
    session_id: str
    phase: str  # "plan_approved", "execution_complete", "critique_passed"
    agent_states: JSON  # Dict[agent_id, AgentState]
    artifacts: List[str]  # Generated outputs
    parent_checkpoint_id: Optional[str]  # For branching
    is_active: bool
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**

### 6.6 Remote Code Execution (Brains vs Hands) 🆕 ✅ (COMPLETE)

**Goal:** Separate reasoning from execution to prevent context contamination

**New Service:** `backend/services/remote_executor/` (Docker container)

**Architecture:**

```
Agent (Brain) → Writes Code → Security Guard → Sandbox → Executor → Summary
     ↑                                                                ↓

- [x] Working set size >> context window size
- [x] Code execution fully sandboxed (Docker isolation)
- [x] Resource limits enforced (CPU, memory, time)

**Docker Service:**

- [x] Create `docker-compose.remote-executor.yml` - Security-hardened, resource-limited
- [x] Create `backend/Dockerfile.remote-executor` - Non-root, minimal image
- [x] Separate network isolation
- [x] Limited resource allocation
- [x] Auto-restart on failure

**Tests:** ✅ 10 ExecutionGuard tests verified inline (all passing)

### 6.7 MCP Server Integration with Constitutional Governance 🆕 (Done)

**File:** `backend/services/mcp_governance.py` (new)

**Goal:** Extend the existing Tool Creation Service (6.1) to support MCP servers as a tool source, with constitutional tier-based approval and audit logging on every invocation.

**Inspired by:** Rowboat's native MCP support — adapted into Agentium's democratic approval model.

**Philosophy:** Rowboat connects MCP tools directly. Agentium connects them through the Constitution.

**Tool Tier System:**

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                 MCP TOOL REGISTRY                    │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Tier 1: Pre-Approved (Council vote to USE)          │
│  ├─ Safe read-only APIs (weather, public data)       │
│  └─ Non-destructive queries                          │
│                                                      │

```

**Integration with Existing 6.1 Tool Creation Service:**

MCP tools enter the same approval pipeline as agent-created tools. The only difference is the source — MCP server vs agent-generated code. Constitutional Guard (2.3) audits every invocation.

**Database Model:**

```python
class MCPTool(BaseEntity):
    name: str
    description: str
    server_url: str
    tier: str                          # "pre_approved", "restricted", "forbidden"
    capabilities: List[str]
    constitutional_article: Optional[str]  # Which article governs this
    approved_by_council: bool = False
    approval_vote_id: Optional[str]
    usage_count: int = 0
    last_used_at: Optional[datetime]
    audit_log: List[Dict]              # Every invocation logged
```

**Implementation:**

- [x] `backend/services/mcp_governance.py` - Core MCP client + constitutional wrapper
- [x] `propose_mcp_server(url, description)` - Council member proposes new MCP server
- [x] `audit_tool_invocation(tool_id, agent_id, action)` - Constitutional Guard hook
- [x] `get_approved_tools(agent_tier)` - Returns tools accessible to agent's tier
- [x] `revoke_mcp_tool(tool_id, reason)` - Emergency revocation without vote
- [x] MCP tool wrapper auto-generates constitutional compliance layer

**Frontend:**

- [x] `frontend/src/components/mcp/ToolRegistry.tsx` - Browse available MCP tools
- [x] Filter by tier, approval status, usage stats
- [x] "Propose new MCP server" modal → triggers Council vote
- [x] Per-tool invocation audit log viewer

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Every MCP tool invocation logged in audit trail with agent_id, timestamp, input hash
- [ ] Tier 3 tools blocked at Constitutional Guard before reaching MCP client
- [ ] Tier 2 tools require Head approval token in request
- [ ] Council vote required to add any new MCP server (same flow as 6.1)
- [ ] Tool registry shows real-time usage stats per tool
- [ ] Revoked tools immediately unavailable (cache invalidation <1s)
- [ ] MCP server health monitored (auto-disable on repeated failures)

**Python Dependencies to Add:**

```
mcp==1.0.0    # Official MCP Python SDK
```

# ✅ Final Verification & System Checklist

---

## 0. Strategic Overview (Scope & Validation Objectives)

### Multi-Channel Integration (Messaging Platforms)

Implement support for the following communication platforms to enable **local-first AI agents** across distributed messaging environments:

- WhatsApp
- Telegram
- Slack
- Discord
- Signal
- Google Chat
- iMessage
- Microsoft Teams
- Zalo
- Matrix

### Priority Classification

**Easy (API-First Platforms)**

- Telegram
- Discord
- Slack

**Moderate Complexity**

- WhatsApp (Baileys)
- Signal (signal-cli)
- Google Chat
- Matrix

**High Complexity**

- iMessage (macOS-only limitations)
- Microsoft Teams (enterprise-level integration complexity)
- Zalo (limited API exposure)

### Architectural Design

- Each communication channel must be mapped to dedicated **Task Agents (3xxxx)**.
- All communication agents must operate under a centralized supervisory agent:  
  **“Communications Council” Lead Agent (2xxxx)**.
- Clear delegation and traceable task routing must be enforced.

---

## 1. Access & Permissions

- Verify that the **Head of Council** possesses full system-level access.
- Confirm full functionality of **Browser Control** capabilities.
- Ensure privilege boundaries are correctly enforced across all user roles.

---

## 2. System Testing

- Conduct comprehensive end-to-end system testing.
- Validate all modules, workflows, routing logic, and fallback systems.
- Confirm no cross-system contamination between reasoning and execution layers.
- Ensure stability under load and multi-agent concurrency.

---

## 3. Memory Management

### 3.1 Database & Vector Database Governance

- Implement structured memory lifecycle management.
- Remove obsolete records and outdated data versions.
- Maintain strict version control policies.
- **The Original Constitution must never be deleted under any circumstances.**

### 3.2 Required System Enhancements

- Provide secure tools to connect to the MCP server.
- Implement automatic API key failover:
  - If one API key fails, automatically switch to the next available key.
- If **no API keys respond**, generate system alerts:
  - Visible notification in the frontend.
  - Background channel alerts for monitoring systems.

---

## 4. Ethos & Message History Management

### 4.1 Ethos Governance

The message history represents the operational **Ethos** of the system and must:

- Be properly stored.
- Be accessible.
- Be editable.
- Be minimized/summarized for efficiency.
- Remain consistent with the Constitution.

### 4.2 Ethos Update Workflow

All agents must follow this standardized workflow:

1. Read the Constitution.
2. Update the individual Ethos.
3. During task execution:
   - Log current actions.
   - Log completed actions.
   - Log pending actions.
4. Apply this workflow universally across all agents.

---

## 5. API Request Validation

- Ensure that **Ethos content is included in every API request** without exception.
- Validate payload structure before dispatch.
- Enforce consistency across providers.

---

# Memory Optimization Framework

## 1. Chat Retention Policy

- Chats older than a defined period (e.g., 7 days) will be removed.
- The last 50 messages must always be retained and protected.
- Conversations must remain concise and precise.

## 2. Task Database Management

- Maintain a structured database of:
  - All user-assigned tasks.
  - Completion status of each task.
- Completed tasks will be removed after a defined retention period (e.g., 7 days).
- **Exception:** The Original Constitution must never be removed.

## 3. Vector Database Optimization

- Establish a unified and standardized structure for skill creation.
- Ensure consistent formatting across all skills.
- Review and update outdated knowledge.
- Remove duplicate embeddings.
- Maintain optimized retrieval performance.

## 4. Agent Availability Control

- New tasks must not be assigned to unavailable agents.
- Enforce agent availability checks before task allocation.

## 5. System-Wide Optimization

Perform optimization without loss of:

- Functionality
- Imported information
- Core operational logic

Optimization areas include:

- Agent lifecycle management (remove idle agents)
- Memory usage
- Storage allocation
- Database indexing
- Log retention (remove very old logs)
- Resource allocation efficiency

---

## 6. Container & Infrastructure Governance

- Optimization inside the container environment must be prioritized.
- External (outside container) optimization must be handled with extreme caution.
- File deletions outside the container require explicit approval from the Sovereign (User).
- No irreversible action outside the container without authorization.

---

## 7. Access Control Policy

- **Admin Users**
  - Full system access.
  - Can view all tasks across the system.

- **Standard Users**
  - Can view only tasks they created.
  - Can interact with the system regarding their own tasks (chat + task interface).

---

## 8. API Key Redundancy Verification

- Verify (or implement if missing):
  - Multiple API keys per provider.
  - Automatic rotation and fallback usage.
  - Provider-level load balancing where applicable.

---

## 9. Agent Optimization & Emergency Protocol

### Normal Optimization

If all agents are occupied:

- The Head of Council must initiate agent optimization.
- Identify and terminate idle agents.
- Free up capacity for new task allocation.

### Emergency Protocol

If:

- No agents are available
- No entity can receive a task

Then:

- The Head of Council may create a temporary emergency agent.
- Only one Head of Council may exist at any time.
- Emergency agent must use an available ID from the reserved Head-of-Council ID space (1xxxx).
- Upon task completion, the emergency agent must be terminated.

Strict enforcement:

- Only one active Head of Council at any time.

---

## 10. Future Scalability Plan

Prepare the system for scaling from:

**50,000 agents → 50,000,000+ agents**

Required changes:

- Expand agent ID length in the database.
- Update frontend display logic for large-scale agent rendering.
- Optimize indexing and retrieval structures.
- Ensure horizontal scalability readiness.

**Inspired by:** Rowboat's Python SDK pattern — rebuilt with Agentium's constitutional context baked in.

**Philosophy:** External callers get the power of Agentium, but never bypass its Constitution.

### 12.1 Python SDK

**Package:** `sdk/python/agentium/`

**Core Interface:**

```python
from agentium import SovereignClient, StatefulSession

client = SovereignClient(
    host="http://localhost:8000",
    api_key="<SOVEREIGN_API_KEY>",
    constitution_version="v1.2.4"   # Pinned — breaks if constitution changes
)

# Start a governed session
session = StatefulSession(client)

# Submit a task — routes through full hierarchy
response = session.delegate(
    task="Analyze Q3 reports and summarize findings",
    constraints={
        "max_cost_usd": 5.00,
        "privacy_level": "internal",
        "allowed_tiers": ["2xxxx", "3xxxx"]
    },
    acceptance_criteria={
        "format": "markdown",
        "max_length_words": 1000,
        "critic_validation": True
    }
)

# Response includes full governance trail
print(response.result)
print(response.constitutional_checks_passed)
print(response.critic_reviews)
print(response.audit_trail)
print(response.cost_usd)
```

**Features:**

- [ ] `SovereignClient` - Authenticated connection with constitution version pinning
- [ ] `StatefulSession` - Maintains conversation context across multiple calls
- [ ] `delegate(task, constraints, acceptance_criteria)` - Full governed task submission
- [ ] `get_audit_trail(session_id)` - Retrieve complete decision log
- [ ] `get_constitution(version)` - Fetch active or historical constitution
- [ ] `propose_amendment(diff)` - Trigger amendment workflow from SDK
- [ ] `list_agents(tier)` - Browse agent hierarchy
- [ ] Streaming support for long-running tasks
- [ ] Async/await support

**Files:**

- [ ] `sdk/python/agentium/__init__.py`

- [ ] `sdk/typescript/src/session.ts`
- [ ] `sdk/typescript/src/types.ts`
- [ ] `sdk/typescript/package.json`
- [ ] `sdk/typescript/README.md`

### 12.3 SDK Governance Rules

**What SDK callers CAN do:**

- [ ] Submit tasks (routed through full hierarchy)
- [ ] Query agent status and audit trail
- [ ] Propose amendments (triggers vote, doesn't bypass it)
- [ ] Read constitution and knowledge base
- [ ] Stream task progress events

**What SDK callers CANNOT do:**
